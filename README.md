# LBP
 To add repository and tag for the docker, we run
 
 ` docker build --compress -t ml/project1:latest .
`

 in the project root folder.

` docker run -p 8080:8000  <CONTAINER_ID> or NAME `

After testing, we can run ` docker push ` command to push our image to docker image registry of cloud providers (such as AWS ECR and GCP Container Registry). Youâ€™ll need to do authentication before being able to push to the repository. Follow the guides from different cloud providers, which will vary from using simple ` docker login ` to installing CLI tool. The command should look like this:

` docker tag ml/project1 [SOME_CONTAINER_REGISTRY]/ml/project1:latest `

` docker push [SOME_CONTAINER_REGISTRY]/ml/project1:latest `
